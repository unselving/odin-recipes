    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Muar is a place in Johor. Otak means brains. However, there are no brains involved in the making of this dish. Instead, it's a delicious soft fish cake that's squishy like a brain (or so I imagine).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>450g fish meat (use Mackerel or Ikan Tenggiri)</li>
      <li>250ml coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 bunch banana leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Seasoning:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp corn flour</li>
      <li>3 tbsp curry powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
      <li>3 tbsp chili paste</li>
      <li>2 tsp salt</li>
      <li> 1 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tsp minced shallot</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Wilt your banana leaves over an open fire. Trim them to 6" x 10".</li>
      <li>Debone your fish by scraping the meat off the bones with a spoon</li>
      <li>Set aside 150g of fish meat. Place the remaining 300g into a food processor along with the coconut milk. Blend into a smooth paste.</li>
      <li>Add the fish paste mixture into a large bowl along with all the seasoning. Mix until smooth, then add in the remaining 150g of fish meat. Leave the 150g fish meat in chunks - do not blend it.</li>
      <li>If the fish paste is too dry, add around 100g of water.</li>
      <li>Taking 100g at a time, wrap otak paste in banana leaves.</li>
      <li>Steam the wrapped otak for 5 minutes under a high flame.</li>
      <li>Grill otak over charcoal fire until slightly charred. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
