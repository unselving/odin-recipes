    <h1>Things I ate in JB</h1>
    <p>Here are recipes for some things I ate on my trip to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. JB is a quick 1+ hour bus trip from Singapore, where I live. If you're Singaporean, I'd recommend that you take a trip across the border to try these dishes, many of which are highly elaborate to make. If you're not in the region, maybe the recipes below can give you some inspiration.</p>
